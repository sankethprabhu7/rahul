1 Motivation
1.1 Current situation:
•	All the payments done by Vendor is associated with some payment term.
•	Payment term defines the invoice payment due date as per baseline date.
•	There are different kind of payment terms for which a Vendor is eligible. 
•	Detection of anomaly is currently done by Fraud Management Team manually.
•	For different modules help of different Subject Matter Experts are required.
•	Auditing of data is done at different levels by visualizing them.
•	There is an existing solution in SAP which checks for certain features and gives us the duplicate invoice only if it is an exact match.
•	System will not allow the user to enter any duplicate invoice in a typical scenario
•	Invoice comes with a Reference number which act as the unique identifier for any posting. Same Reference No. can occur for different Vendor ID’s or for different sets of amount.
•	Posting date is filled manually so there is no restriction.
1.2 Concerns or pain areas:
•	If any unusual payments are posted then it cannot be detected easily in large dataset. 
•	Every data has to be manually checked resulting in some fraudulent transactions getting missed.
•	There is less transparency in checking which may lead to give some false results.
•	Since lots of manual work is needed it is prone to errors.
•	The process is very time consuming and resource intensive.
•	The company incurs huge losses due to fraudulent transactions.
•	Even if there is a slight difference between two invoices SAP will not catch it.
•	If two Vendors are posting same amount at a particular date with similar Reference number then it won’t be caught.
